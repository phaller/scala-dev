/**

 *   Provides lightweight, concurrent actors. Actors are

 *   `act` method:
 *   
 *   {{{
 *   class MyActor extends Actor {
 *     def act() {
 *       // actor behavior goes here
 *     }
 *   }
 *   }}}
 *   
 *   A new `Actor` instance is started by invoking its `start` method.
 *   
 *   '''Note:''' care must be taken when invoking thread-blocking methods
 *   other than those provided by the `Actor` trait or its companion
 *   object (such as `receive`). Blocking the underlying thread inside
 *   an actor may lead to starvation of other actors. This also
 *   applies to actors hogging their thread for a long time between
 *   invoking `receive`/`react`.
 *   
 *   If actors use blocking operations (for example, methods for
 *   blocking I/O), there are several options:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>The run-time system can be configured to use a larger thread pool size
 *     (for example, by setting the `actors.corePoolSize` JVM property).</li>
 *     
 *     <li>The `scheduler` method of the `Actor` trait can be overridden to return a 
 *     `ResizableThreadPoolScheduler`, which resizes its thread pool to
 *     avoid starvation caused by actors that invoke arbitrary blocking methods.</li>
 *     
 *     <li>The `actors.enableForkJoin` JVM property can be set to `false`, in which 
 *     case a `ResizableThreadPoolScheduler` is used by default to execute actors.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </p>
